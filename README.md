Current working demo available at [movie-search](https://moviesearch.now.sh/)

## Pre-requisite
- This app uses paid api from [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). Hence, `REACT_APP_API_KEY` environment variable written in `.env` file at the root directory is not committed here. Please check out the website for details. It's not expensive.

  ```
